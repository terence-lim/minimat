MINIMAT: Extensible Matrix Language in OCaml LLVM (compiler for Columbia University COMS4115)

Coded in OCaml, OCamllex and OCamlyacc, this implements flexible expressions 
for manipulating matrix and sequence data types with a highly stripped-down
subset of C (Micro C: ints, bools, and void types, arithmetic, if-else, for,
and while statements, and user-defined functions), and compiles it to LLVM IR.

It needs the OCaml llvm library, which is most easily installed through opam.
It also optionally calls external gnuplot routines for plotting graphs (public 
domain gnuplot_i library written by N.Devillard included in the src subdirectory).
